The theme displays the logo in the sidebar of every documentation site.

## Current Logo

- **File**: `assets/logo.svg`
- **Format**: SVG with `viewBox="0 0 1000 1000"`
- **Primary color**: Cloud Red (`#e4002b`)

## How It's Referenced

In `astro.config.mjs`, the logo is passed to the Starlight `logo` option:

```js
starlight({
  logo: {
    src: './theme/assets/logo.svg',
  },
})
```

The `./theme/` prefix is required because the builder workflow checks out this theme repository into a `theme/` directory inside the build workspace.

## Replacing the Logo

1. **Create your SVG** — use a square or near-square aspect ratio for best results in the sidebar
2. **Save it** to `assets/` (e.g., `assets/my-logo.svg`)
3. **Update `astro.config.mjs`** to point to the new file:
   ```js
   logo: {
     src: './theme/assets/my-logo.svg',
   },
   ```

### Guidelines

- **Use SVG format** — raster images (PNG, JPG) will work but won't scale cleanly at all sizes
- **Include a `viewBox`** — ensures the logo scales proportionally (e.g., `viewBox="0 0 100 100"`)
- **Keep file size small** — the logo loads on every page; aim for under 10 KB
- **Test in both themes** — verify the logo looks correct in both light and dark mode
- **Starlight also supports separate light/dark logos** via `logo.light` and `logo.dark` if needed:
  ```js
  logo: {
    light: './theme/assets/logo-light.svg',
    dark: './theme/assets/logo-dark.svg',
  },
  ```
