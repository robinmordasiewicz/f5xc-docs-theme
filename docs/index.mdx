## How It Works

This repository is **not a standalone site**. It is a theme layer consumed at build time by content repositories through the [f5xc-docs-builder](https://github.com/robinmordasiewicz/f5xc-docs-builder) reusable workflow.

```
Content repo push
  → f5xc-docs-builder workflow runs
    → Checks out this theme into ./theme/
    → Astro build references theme fonts, styles, logo, and footer
    → Site deploys with consistent F5 branding
```

Updating a file in this repository propagates to every documentation site on its next build.
